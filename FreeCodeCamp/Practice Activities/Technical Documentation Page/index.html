          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
          (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
          objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
          them.          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
